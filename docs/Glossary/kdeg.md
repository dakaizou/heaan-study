The degree of the function approximating sigmoid function, the higher the degree is, the more accurate the result will be. It will also consume more noise budget. Possible options are `3`, `5`, `7`

```c++
static double degree3[3] = {-0.5,0.15012,-0.001593};
static double degree5[4] = {-0.5,0.19131,-0.0045963, 0.0000412332};
static double degree7[5] = {-0.5,0.216884,-0.00819276,0.000165861,-0.00000119581};
```
